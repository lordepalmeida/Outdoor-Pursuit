These are the top places to take to the seas – spectacular views and wildlife guaranteed.<br></p><p><br></p><h3>Best all-rounder: New Zealand</h3><p>With jaw-dropping scenery, abundant wildlife and a proven pedigree in paddling, New Zealand is hard to beat as an all-round sea kayaking destination. You’ll find calm, warm-weather options (particularly in North Island), as well as white-knuckle paddles in more extreme locations such as Fiordland.<br><br><strong>Where to kayak:<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>North Island’s watery playground, the Bay of Islands, offers everything from game fishing and scuba diving to swimming with dolphins.It is also a perfect place for sea kayaking with some 150 islands to explore and a climate that won’t make you shudder at the prospect of getting wet.​</p><p>Nip across Cook Strait and you have a choice of two kayaking hotspots at the northern tip of South Island. Base yourself at Picton or Havelock for forays into the labyrinth of bays and inlets comprising the Malborough Sounds and head to Marahau or Totaranui, gateways to Abel Tasman National Park with its sandy beaches and forest-fringed estuaries.</p><p>Fiordland is a Mecca for sea kayakers, with slightly more challenging paddling in Milford and Doubtful Sounds, while Paterson Inlet on Stewart Island promises hardy souls close encounters with marine life and a chance to visit some of New Zealand’s most ancient and intact forests.<br></p><p><strong>Top tip:</strong>&nbsp;Take a pair of waterproof binoculars with you – New Zealand has an extraordinary range of seabirds, including penguin and albatross.</p><p><strong>Also consider: </strong>Australia</p><p>​Boasting a diverse range of coastal scenery, from coral islands and kelp-fringed estuaries to vast bays covered with seagrass meadows, Australia’s prime kayaking locations include the Whitsunday Islands, Tasmania and the Ningaloo Reef.​</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3>Best for wildlife: Baja California, Mexico</h3><p>If you’ve ever thrilled at the sight of a whale from a tour boat just imagine what it’s like from the perspective of a sea kayak! Although close encounters are never guaranteed (and you should always respect minimum viewing distances to avoid disturbance), Baja California provides an unrivalled opportunity to paddle with cetaceans.</p><p>​<strong>Where to kayak:<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>There are two main choices. Between January and April, grey whale visit the Pacific coast of Baja to socialise, mate and give birth, often congregating in lagoons such as Magdalena Bay. These broad swathes of shallow water, with their mangrove-filled creeks, are ideal for kayaking. As well as whale and dolphin, you’ll see plenty of waterbirds, along with sealion hauled out on the long, sandy beaches.&nbsp;</p><p>East of the Baja peninsula, the Sea of Cortez (or Gulf of California) is a wintering ground for blue, fin, humpback, sperm, short-finned pilot, minke and Bryde’s whale, as well as several species of dolphin. A multiday adventure will also enable you to experience the unique flora and fauna of the Sonoran Desert.​<br></p><p>​<strong>Top tip:<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>Ensure all food is securely hidden overnight beneath your kayak’s storage hatches, otherwise you may attract scavenging coyotes.</p><p>​<strong>Also consider: </strong>British Columbia, Canada &amp; Swakopmund, Namibia<br>​Visit the Johnstone Strait and Blackfish Sound region off the north-east coast of Vancouver Island and you may be lucky enough to kayak with a pod of orca. Although a resident population hunts in this section of the Inside Passage, the best time to see orca is when they follow the salmon run between late June and August.<br></p>', b'1', 1),

Read these tips first: they\'ll make the difference between an enjoyable journey and a literal pain in the backside!</p><p><br></p><h3>1. Trip selection</h3><p>So you want to do a multi-day horse trek. The first thing to choose is your destination and tour operator (the former usually dictates the latter). Now for the trickiest decision: what is your skill level?<br><br>Are you a regular rider? Or did you last ride when you were a child? Find out what level of rider you need to be for the specific trip you’re interested in. Do not overestimate your skill level. Yes, a lot of operators want you to pick their trip, but the good ones won\'t put you in a dangerous situation if you\'re not equipped to cope with it.<br><br>Don\'t choose an African wildlife safari on horseback if you\'re not able to handle a horse spooking at a lion or potentially needing to gallop away from an angry charging rhino. Equally, don’t choose a mountain trip if you’re scared of heights: a narrow mountain trail is ten times scarier on horseback.<br></p><p><br></p><h3>2. Equipment provided</h3><p>What equipment is provided? Will the operator/organiser be supplying hard hats? And to what standard? Whatever the terrain you\'ll be traversing, hard hats should be worn. If you\'re thrown from the horse, it only takes a bang against the ground to cause life-changing injuries. And if hats aren\'t provided, are you willing to risk those sorts of injuries on a horse you don\'t know in terrain you\'re unfamiliar with?<br><br>Also, what about saddle bags? Will there be saddle bags for your day needs, to hold a water bottle and your camera? How will your big bags make it between overnight stops? If they\'re moved by horse/donkey then any bags normally need to be soft-sided duffel bags and certainly not hard sided suitcases.<br><br>Do they provide boots, waterproofs or chaps? It may save you from buying your own – or you might feel more comfortable in your own kit.<br></p><p><br></p><h3>3. Your equipment</h3><p>What clothing will you be taking? Which trousers, for example, will you be riding in? While jodhpurs or riding jeans (not normal jeans!) are ideal, your packing space may not stretch to a full riding-only wardrobe if riding is only part of the trip.<br><br>Walking trousers are a good replacement for jodhpurs if they have a flat seam, but you risk the trousers riding up and your leg chafing on the stirrup leathers. Men in particular will find it uncomfortable as the hairs on your legs will get caught and pulled.<br><br>The solution is to invest in a pair of chaps: leg coverings. However, if you don’t want the complete cowboy look, half-chaps (covering from below your knee to your ankle) will suffice. If you don\'t want to buy a pair, double check whether chaps can be provided on the trip.<br><br>You will also need good boots with a stiff sole and a bit of a heel. If you\'re not taking dedicated riding boots then walking boots will suffice – just make sure they\'re not too wide for the stirrup as you run the risk of your foot getting caught if you have an accident.<br><br></p><h3>4. Have some lessons</h3><p>If you\'re not a regular rider, have some lessons and hacks (rides out) before you go. This is probably the biggest tip to avoid becoming saddle sore and getting that John Wayne walk. It\'s all to do with lengthening the muscles in your legs and getting them used to holding a pose for hours at a time.<br><br>If you\'re going over up and down terrain, you need to be shifting your weight back and forth to help the horse with its balance. Also, if you\'re trotting, you need to be bringing your weight out of the saddle and gently back again – you can make yourself and the horse very uncomfortable by banging up and down.<br><br>The preparation will depend on the length of your trip, the terrain you\'ll be going over, your existing experience and how many hours per day you\'ll be in the saddle for. At a minimum for a five-day trek, you should be riding 2-3 times per week for 1-2 hours per session.&nbsp;Lessons will give you much more confidence when getting on an unknown horse, and improve your balance too. You should be comfortable walking and trotting at the very least and – depending on your trip requirements – you may also need to master cantering, galloping and even jumping.</p><p><br></p><h3>5. Camera gear</h3><p>No doubt you\'ll want to take photos on your trip but think about the logistics first. Trying to hold a large DSLR camera while on horseback (even stationary) is not easy. It\'s also not comfortable to have it bouncing up and down on your chest when trotting.</p><p>Check whether a saddlebag is provided so you can keep your camera within easy reach. Or is your phone camera good enough for any in-the-saddle shots? You\'ll want an option that you can use one-handed, so you can still keep grip on the reins...</p><p><br></p><h3>7. Enjoy yourself!</h3><p>Don\'t forget to relax and have fun! Doing a trip like this creates a real bond between man and beast, and you\'ll get a unique perspective on your destination.</p>', b'1', 2),

	(14, 'Skydive', 'colors.jpg', 'First-time Skydiving', '<p>Skydiving, while a fun sport for the free-spirited, is not a cakewalk. You\'ll have to overcome extreme nerves and brace yourself for a jump that’s about 10,000 ft high in the air. Don’t fret! If you’re a first-time skydiver and don\'t know what to expect, we’re here to help. Our guide will help you go in fully prepared so that you have a truly memorable experience.<br></p><p>Here are some useful pointers to make your first skydiving experience smooth sailing:</p><ol><li><strong>Prepare yourself mentally:<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>There isn\'t much physical effort involved in skydiving. You have to get on a place, ride on it to a considerable height and then of course, jump (either with an instructor or on your own). Gravity does the rest of the work. More than your physical self, skydiving tests your mental strength. Taking that first step off the plane requires immense conviction and you can achieve that by not overthinking and simply living in the moment. Before you jump, think about the wonderful view below and the experience of free-falling over it.</li><li><strong>Low fatality rate:<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>The United States Parachute Association has released startling numbers that highlight just how safe skydiving has become over time. With a fatality rate of less than 0.10, you don\'t have to worry about having a bad skydiving experience since deaths in skydiving are extremely rare.</li><li><strong>What to wear:<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>If it\'s your first time skydiving, you need to be aware of what to wear. We would recommend opting for close-fitting athletic clothing with lace-up sneakers. Wearing close-fitting clothes is important because you\'ll also be wearing a skydiving jumpsuit on top and the thinner your clothes are, the more comfortable you\'ll be. It is essential your clothes and shoes do not get caught in the parachute.</li><li><strong>What to eat:<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>When it comes to food intake before skydiving, moderation is key. Eat a light, nutritious meal before arriving at the dropzone so that you have enough energy to participate in and enjoy your first skydiving experience. Also, stay hydrated throughout the activity because that will help calm your nerves as well. Strictly avoid alcohol or any narcotics up to 24 hours before your skydiving experience.</li><li><strong>Learn more:<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>Talking to experienced skydivers is very crucial for first-time skydivers. There\'s a lot of knowledge to be shared and there\'s no better source for it than someone who skydives regularly. From tips on the best position to encouragement and motivation for the jump, a professional skydiver will help you in every way possible.</li><li><strong>Length of a skydive:<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>On average, a skydiving experience lasts for five to six minutes. Of this, approximately 40-50 seconds are spent freefalling while the remaining four to five minutes involve the parachute ride down. Mentally prepare to spend this much time on the air and don\'t try to rush the process.</li></ol>', b'1', 4),

The vast territory that makes up the US and Canada is a place of mythic journeys, eye-boggling scenery, and – beyond those headline-grabbing, culture-dominating cities – raw wilderness.<br></p><p>The US National Parks Service oversees nearly 400 protected areas, including Yellowstone (the oldest) and Alaska’s Wrangell St-Elias (the biggest; larger than Switzerland). And north of the 49th parallel, Canada has endless emptiness, home to wolf, bear and moose, much of which can only be accessed by floatplane.</p><p>So, given the scale of the place, your first thought should be how to get around. Domestic flights are extensive and affordable (particularly if you buy an air pass), but for romance and views stick at ground level. Hire a car or a campervan, ride the Greyhound bus or take the Amtrak railway (in the US) or VIA Rail (in Canada) for a days-long trundle between cities.</p><p>Some of the best journeys are offshore, too: the ferry journey through Alaska’s Inside Passage is a gold-rush history lesson and whale-watching extravaganza rolled into one.</p><p>Once you’ve got your transport sorted, pick your highlights. You’d need months to scratch the surface of the whole continent, so instead focus on a big trip (coast to coast, Route 66, California’s Pacific Coast Highway) or a region (the Great Lakes; the ‘Four Corners’ region of the Southwest; Vancouver and the Canadian West). North America may be all about big journeys, but don’t forget to stop and linger too.</p><p>Finally, try to meet some of North America’s indigenous people. In the southern US, Native American traditions are alive and well (try New Mexico). In Canada, there’s an increasing variety of First Nations experiences from homestays to Inuit-led wildlife cruises. Their insights prove there’s far more to North American culture than Hollywood and Broadway.</p><p>So what are you waiting for? Start planning your trip to North America today...</p>', '<p>It would take a lifetime to do proper justice to the variety of experiences on offer in North America, but here are a few ideas for starters<br></p><ol><li><strong>Take a great rail journey</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>– rail travel is one of the best ways to see great swaths of North America breezing past (many of the trains even have special transparent-roofed viewing carriages for better sightseeing): you\'re only limited by the amount of time you have. Try an Amtrak or VIA Rail pass for the best value.<strong><br></strong></li><li><strong>Watch polar bears, Churchill, Manitoba<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>– in the remote, frozen town of Churchill, Canada, nestled on the shores of Hudson Bay, having a good bear story to tell counts for a lot. The good news is it is pretty hard to leave without one of your own. Take to the tundra in a big-wheeled buggy in October/November for the best chance of a sighting.</li><li><strong>Hike the gold-rush trail, Yukon<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>– hike along the Klondike River near Dawson City, Yukon, Canada. About 390 tons of the yellow stuff have been taken from the Klondike area in the century since its discovery – it\'s worth having a go and panning for some of your own.</li><li><strong>Experience New York State –<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>hike or climb in the Catskills; canoe, kayak, raft and camp as you explore the Finger Lakes; nip into the wineries – there\'s more to the state than<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>big city. Though a stop-off in the Big Apple is fun too!<strong><br></strong></li><li><strong>Ride Alaska’s Marine Highway<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>– Alaska\'s Marine Highway is a lifeline for remote coastal communities – luckily, it is also the best way to see Alaska\'s rugged wilderness, scenic beauty and abundant wildlife as the ferries run up the Inside Passage and out to the Aleutian Islands.<strong><br></strong></li><li><strong>Cycle Canada’s Gulf Islands<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>– try pedal-powered island-hopping on the southern, Canadian section of the bohemian Gulf Islands archipelago: Saltspring, Pender, Saturna, Mayne and Galiano islands await.<strong><br></strong></li><li><strong>Explore Arctic wilderness, Nunavut, Canada<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>– Nunavut is a land so vast and harsh that few people have even dared to explore it. Visit Nunavut and witness how the Inuit have thrived for centuries in harmony with the extreme conditions and rugged landscape.</li><li><strong>Gawp at the Grand Canyon, Arizona<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>– stare, open-mouthed as nearly two billion years of geological history lays exposed at your feet. Stand on the rim for great vistas, or hike down into the canyon, camp at the bottom and hike out the next day. Perhaps the ultimate trip: raft the length of the Colorado River for the true insider\'s view.</li><li><strong>Camp with wolves, Isle Royale NP<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>– one of the USA\'s remote national parks is a great place to camp out and listen for wolves at night as they call to each other across the island.<strong><br></strong></li><li><strong>Discover wild Hawaii<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>– the USA\'s Pacific-marooned state is more than themed aloha-luaus: hike lava fields and volcanos, and spot dolphins, whales and sea turtles, wild deer and boar when you get off the beaten track.</li></ol>', b'1'),

The mighty Andes support the world’s highest capital city (La Paz), as well as the highest mountain (6,962m Aconcagua) and highest railway (from Lima to Huancayo) outside Asia.</p><p>For culture vultures Mexico and the compact countries of Central America are the heartlands of the Maya and Aztec civilisations, and Maya sites such as Chichen Itza (Mexico), Tikal (Guatemala) and Copan (Honduras) retain the power to thrill – despite high tourist numbers.</p><p>Further south there are also myriad opportunities to meet today’s tribal groups in Amazon ecolodges, offering a fascinating insight into the rainforest, an often surprising level of comfort, and, when well-managed, a viable economic future for marginalised people.</p><p>For walkers, Peru and Patagonia are classic destinations. The trek to the Inca city of Machu Picchu (Latin America’s biggest tourist draw) heads a long list of Peruvian trails combining stunning scenery and ancient cultures. In Chile, the jagged peaks of Torres Del Paine are the iconic image of Patagonia, the southern wilderness shared with Argentina.</p><p>For wildlife enthusiasts, the most bio-diverse area of the planet awaits, with Brazil, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia all offering access to the mighty Amazon. But many other parks or areas best the Amazon for actual sightings: try Brazil’s Pantanal or Guyana’s Iwokrama for jaguar; Mexico’s Baja peninsula for whales and whale sharks; Central America for birds; the Galapagos Islands for, well, extremely close encounters.</p><p>If you’ve got a few months to spare, Latin America is a thrilling region to explore overland. Travellers on the ‘gringo trail’ frequently start in the sophisticated cities of Rio or Buenos Aires, or work their way south from Mexico City.</p><p>Local transport is variable: the overcrowded ‘chicken bus’ and ramshackle pickups remain stalwarts; trains are few but spectacular. Flights are an increasingly popular way of handling some of the huge distances involved (Brazil alone is 35 times bigger than the UK), but remain expensive.</p><p>Wherever you’re going, two useful resources are the Latin American Travel Association (LATA) – whose members comprise the UK’s leading Latin American tour operators – and the South American Explorers Club, which offers independent travel advice and friendly clubhouses in Lima, Cusco, Quito and Buenos Aires.</p><p>So what are you waiting for?

Book early to ensure you get a place on the classic Inca Trail, or consider one of the quieter alternative routes.</li><li><strong>Explore the Galapagos, Ecuador</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>– Darwin’s wildlife wonderland shows evolution in action, and offers extremely up-close wildlife encounters with frollicking sea lions, scaly iguanas, giant tortoises and a range of curious birds (don\'t miss the courtship dances of both the albatross and the blue-footed booby).</li><li><strong>Go jaguar-spotting, Brazil</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>– the Pantanal wetland is simply the cat’s whiskers: it\'s one of very few places where jaguar are regularly spotted, along with a whole host of other wildlife. August and September are the peak months for big cat sightings.</li><li><strong>Hike the wilds of Patagonia</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>– a travel word to conjure with, Patagonia is a sweeping land of lakes, rock spires and wilderness, offering fantastic trekking. The Torres del Paine Circuit is a classic, though other options abound. Try northern Patagonia to escape the crowds.</li><li><strong>Riding the rails, South America</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>– the Devil’s Nose, the Train to the Clouds – the names of the continent\'s rail routes say it all. The trains here are more scenic spectaculars than a means to get around: there are few services, but those that do exist offer world-class experiences.</li><li><strong>Whale-watch in Baja California, Mexico</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>– a bounty of marine riches: in winter the Pacific coast of this peninsula is home to pretty much the entire population of grey whales, while the Sea of Cortez, on Baja\'s east, is a sheltered calving ground for fin, sperm, humpback and even blue whales; the best time for blues is January to March.</li><li><strong>Follow the Maya Route, Guatemala</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>– a museum in the rainforest: trek into the jungle of Guatemala for an Indiana Jones adventure. Pyramids such as Tikal are well excavated; for a more rugged adventure head for little-visited and rainforest-hidden El Mirador.</li><li><strong>Experience Carnival, Brazil</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>– Rio gets the headlines, but the February/March street parades in Salvador and Recife get the connoisseurs: expect samba moves, exuberant costumes and a real locals\' party.</li><li><strong>F</strong><strong>all for Cartagena, Colombia</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>– this Unesco-listed, coastal gem of a city has deservedly put Colombia back on the map; wander the pastel-coloured streets and soak up the ambiance. Visit in January for the Hay Literary Festival.</li><li><strong>Salar de Uyuni salt flats, Bolivia</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>– this high-altitude, incredibly flat and vastly spreading salt pan is one of the world\'s weirdest places. Stay at a hotel made of salt blocks, meet the resident flamingoes and go on a (long) drive to appreciate the scale.</li></ol>', b'1'),

Pack a good book and prepare to drink a lot of tea and vodka with your carriage-mates: outside your window Europe turns into Asia.</li><li><strong>Visit Luang Prabang, Laos</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>– this laidback town on the banks of the Mekong River is travellers\' heaven: see orange-robed monks wandering amid the temples, shop for local crafts, take a cookey class and then eat the spoils with a cold Beer Lao.</li><li><strong>Stay in a tribal longhouse, Borneo</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>– gain an insight into tribal life by bedding down with a local family in their traditional home; a stay will likely include homecooking, jungle walks and a bit of a sing song.</li><li><strong>Take a city break in Istanbul, Turkey</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>– East meets West, Europe meets Asia: the Bosphorus, which runs through Istanbul, divides the continents in this most fascinating of places.</li><li><strong>Trek to Everest Base Camp, Nepal</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>– the summit might be for only a few hardy (and wealthy) mountaineers, but anyone with an ounce of fitness can tackle the spectacular trek to the base of the world\'s highest mountain.</li><li><strong>See the Taj Mahal, India</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>– true love sculpted in marble, this impossibly romantic mausoleum is a travel great: get up pre-dawn to see it before the crowds arrive.</li><li><strong>Cruise the backwaters, Kerala</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>– take to an old rice barge and float along the languid waterways of southern India. Dine on divine veggie food, watch fishermen cast their nets and generally let life pass you by.</li><li><strong>Meet a panda, China</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>– though increasingly rare, you can still spot pandas: for guaranteed sightings, head to the research centre in Chengdu; for more adventure (and the chance of a wild encounter) trek into Sichuan\'s Qinling Mountains.</li><li><strong>Explore Angkor, Cambodia</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>– this temple complex is vast. Do wander the central structures of Angkor Wat and see the big stone heads of the Bayon temple, but allow time to explore the outer (and less-visited) sites to add adventure.</li><li><strong>Cruise Halong Bay, Vietnam</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>– board a traditional junk boat and float amid the karst islands and fishing communities of northern Vietnam. Adrenalin junkies can try a range of activities too, including world-class rock climbing.</li></ol>', b'1'),

Add in the 7,500 beguiling isles of the South Pacific – from the enigmatic big heads of Easter Island to the land-divers of Vanuatu – and you have a traveller-friendly region with enormous depth and variety.&nbsp;</p><p>The classic first-timer’s tour of Australia – ‘Sydney, Rock and Reef’ – ticks off its world icons: the feelgood harbour city, the jaw-dropping desert monolith of Uluru (Ayers Rock), and the divers’ paradise of the Great Barrier Reef. Many equally rewarding experiences lie further afield. though. Western Australia offers true wilderness adventures in the outback; Arnhem Land, in the Northern Territory, is perhaps the best place to learn about Aboriginal culture; and Tasmania boasts world class rafting, hiking and rainforest.&nbsp;</p><p>New Zealanders like to call their home ‘God’s Own Country’, and for anyone with a taste for outdoors, they’re probably right. The larger, craggier South Island often grabs the headlines, but the North Island is quieter and no less beautiful. Take your pick from fjord-lined Milford Sound, the coastal Abel Tasman and Queen Charlotte tracks, the volcanic Tongariro Crossing – and dozens more hiking gems.&nbsp;Want to go faster? Queenstown is a mecca for adrenaline sports – the bungee jump and many more lunatic endeavours were invented here. New Zealand’s Maori culture is also fascinating and easily accessible through museums, cultural tours and homestays. This part of the world is often called Oceania, and for good reason: the South Pacific defines everything from Bondi Beach’s surfers to New Zealand’s yachties. And strung out to the north and east of New Zealand, the far-flung islands of Polynesia – settled by pioneering sailors – retain a strong seafaring culture. Most visited is Fiji, the hub of South Pacific air travel. Here there are luxury resorts a-plenty, but also many chances to experience traditional, conservative Polynesian village life. Nearby(ish) Samoa is emerging as a less-developed alternative. Tonga has world-class humpback whale-watching and the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu have great diving and are home to remarkable tribal cultures. Further afield, paradise islands like Rarotonga, Tahiti and Bora Bora are firmly in luxury honeymoon territory.

	(6, 'Caribbean', 'lago.jpg', 'Caribbean TRAVEL ADVICE', '<p>If occasional crises – hurricanes, revolutions and most recently, Haiti\'s devastating earthquake – have crumpled this picture postcard view, the Caribbean remains a region largely devoted to the good life.<br></p><p>First, some geography. The islands are divided into three broad groups. To the west are the Greater Antilles: mainly independent countries including Cuba, Jamaica and Puerto Rico. To the east is the long, curving necklace of the Lesser Antilles, which are in turn divided into the tiny Leewards (Anguilla down to Antigua) and the slightly-less-tiny Windwards (including Dominica, Grenada, St Lucia and Barbados).</p><p>If you’re simply looking to fly in and flop on a perfect beach, you’re spoilt for choice. Antigua, Anguilla, Barbuda and the Turks and Caicos Islands have some of the longest and quietest sands in the world, while St Vincent and the Grenadines have beaches of squeak-fine white silica.</p><p>If you want to actually do something on your trip, though, you have more options than you might think. Seafaring and colonial history is everywhere: you can tour Nelson’s Dockyard in Antigua, visit the oldest city in the New World – Santa Domingo – in the Dominican Republic, and hike the oldest protected forest in the west at Main Ridge, Tobago.&nbsp; Communist Cuba is the most culturally rich island, with its mesmerising capital Havana, irrepressible rumba and salsa music, and opportunities to stay in cheap B&amp;Bs run by ordinary Cubans –<span style="box-sizing: inherit;">&nbsp;</span><em>casas particulares</em>.</p><p>Although rarely thought of as an ecotourism destination, many Caribbean islands offer great hiking and wildlife opportunities. Away from Jamaica’s all-inclusive resorts lie the cool Blue Mountains and wild Cockpit Country, and Dominica, Grenada and St Lucia all offer stunning rainforest walks. Sailing and diving are world class too – try the sheltered British Virgin Islands for sailing courses, and the Cayman Islands for epic, coral-encrusted wall dives.</p><p>Although the Caribbean is not ideally set-up (or economical) for island-hopping, various clusters of islands can be tackled this way. Mailboats still ply the waters between St Vincent and Grenada; the French creole islands around Guadeloupe are joined by hydrofoil; and ferry-linked Trinidad &amp; Tobago make an appealing double-act. For longer itineraries, you’ll need to use inter-island ‘hopper’ planes, or transit via hub airports in Barbados, Antigua or Jamaica.</p><p>Finally, is it expensive? Well, yes – the Caribbean can loosen your wallet faster than a Carnival shimmy. But if you travel in shoulder season (late November to mid December, mid April to late May), book independent accommodation or guesthouses and research flight options carefully, you can still enjoy the Caribbean dream without an MI6 expense account.</p><p>So what are you waiting for? Start planning your Caribbean adventure today…</p>', '<p>Blue skies, bluer waters, palm trees and cocktails... all true, but there\'s a lot more to the varied islands of the Caribbean. Ditch your beach towel and do something less boring<br></p><ol><li><strong>Wander Old Havana, Cuba<span style="box-sizing: inherit;">&nbsp;</span></strong>– the crumbling capital of Cuba is an intoxicating mix of colonial architecture, seafront promenading, mojitos and pulsing salsa bars. Some of the centre\'s old mansions have been renovated and are now stylish hotels, making for an atmospheric stay.</li><li><strong>Island-hop through St Vincent and the Grenadines</strong><span style="box-sizing: inherit;">&nbsp;</span>– board the mailboats with the locals (and their families/luggage/chickens) for Caribbean \'cruising\' with a more human feel.</li><li><strong>Dive Bloody Bay Wall, Cayman Islands</strong><span style="box-sizing: inherit;">&nbsp;</span>– just off Little Cayman island the sea floor makes a dramatic plunge, dropping 2,000m – and producing one of the most vibrant, wildlife-rich dive sites in the region.</li><li><strong>Visit volcanic Montserrat<span style="box-sizing: inherit;">&nbsp;</span></strong>– in 1995 a massive eruption decimated the capital of Montserrat, and much of the population was forced to flee; now, the crater still rumbles but travellers can visit the island (volcanic activity permitting) to see the dramatic smoke plumes and fascinating lava flows.</li><li><strong>Hike up the Pitons, St Lucia</strong><span style="box-sizing: inherit;">&nbsp;</span>– known as a honeymoon hub, St Lucia also boasts some of the Caribbean\'s most dramatic scenery; the steep hike up the Pitons is one of the best treks in the region.</li><li><strong>Explore Jamaica’s coffee country</strong><span style="box-sizing: inherit;">&nbsp;</span>– the rolling Blue Mountains offer a different facet of this chilled-out island; hike amid lush greenery and butterflies to find small clapperboard farm villages and great views.</li><li><strong>Kayak through phosphorescence, Puerto Rico</strong><span style="box-sizing: inherit;">&nbsp;</span>– on Vieques<br>Island there are bays that bloom with bioluminescent plankton – swim or paddle here at night to watch the micro-organisms put on a dazzling watery light show.</li><li><strong>Experience Mardi Gras, Trinidad</strong><span style="box-sizing: inherit;">&nbsp;</span>– the Caribbean\'s biggest party takes over Trinidad every February/March. Expect outlandish costumes, loud calypso tunes and no sleep!</li><li><strong>Walk and whale-watch, Dominica</strong><span style="box-sizing: inherit;">&nbsp;</span>– the Caribbean\'s \'nature isle\' is lush, green and undeveloped, and perfect for hiking. Head inland to trek around dormant craters, or sail offshore to see breaching whales (best November to March).</li><li><strong>Learn to sail, British Virgin Islands</strong><span style="box-sizing: inherit;">&nbsp;</span>– BVI\'s calm and sheltered waters are the perfect place to get to grips with jibs and main sails.

	(7, 'Europe', 'flor.jpg', 'Europe travel advice', '<p>From the classical rubble of Athens and Rome to the castles of southern Spain, the pomp of Victorian London to the vineyards of Champagne, the ideas and institutions of Europe have spread to every corner of the world.<br></p><p>Nowhere has such a density of iconic, art-and-architecture-packed cities. Barcelona, Granada, Venice, Palermo, Paris, Avignon… between them Spain, France and Italy could easily fill a year of weekend breaks. And for longer stays, there are numerous historic regions to explore at leisure: the Moorish towns of Andalucia in Spain; the Renaissance cities of northern Italy; the Loire Valley chateaux in France.</p><p>But Europe has its wild side too. The great mountain chain of the Alps is the birthplace of world climbing, and Switzerland and Austria lay claim to breathtaking scenery criss-crossed by hiking trails. Norway’s fjords are truly epic and (outside the peak summer cruising season) remarkably quiet. North of the Artic Circle, Lapland offers husky sledding, Sami culture and the much-imitated Ice Hotel. Scotland’s Highlands and Islands has vast sweeps of moor, forest and crag; Iceland and southern Italy are dominated by volcanoes; Almeria in southern Spain even has a desert.</p><p>Southern Europe is defined by the balmy Mediterranean Sea, and its coastal towns and islands are where package tourism made some of its biggest mistakes – and started to learn from them. Islands like Tenerife, Malta, Ibiza, Mallorca, Corfu and Cyprus all have interesting hinterlands away from the resort strips, and reward exploration.</p><p>The former Soviet countries of Eastern Europe are catching up fast with the neighbours – and, outside the Euro currency, benefiting from lower prices. With its plethora of Adriatic islands, Croatia is already well-established as an alternative to Greece. Romania, Poland, Belarus and Ukraine harbour bears, wolves and untrammelled rural landscapes; the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have historic cities (and great saunas). On the Soviet front line, Germany’s capital Berlin has now been reunited for 20 years, and repeatedly tops ‘favourite city’ lists.</p><p>Perhaps the best way to explore Europe is by rail. This is a continent of relatively small countries, and you can whisk from big city to mountain to coast – and on to a whole new country – in a few hours. Inter-rail (for European citizens only) and Eurail passes (for others) give access to 30 countries, and have kick-started many great travelling lives. For UK residents, Rail Europe has fares, routes and passes.</p><p>So what are you waiting for?

Longer treks will unearth innumerable volcanic treasures.</li><li><strong>Marvel at the Alhambra, Granada, Spain</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>– the Moorish palace and fortress complex that dominates the Andalucian city is a delight of courtyards, pools and ornate chambers. It gets busy though – a good guide will steer you away from the crowds.</li><li><strong>Cruise Norway’s fjords</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>– the Unesco-listed inlets of the Norwegian coast are as dramatic as they are far-reaching, stretching way up into the Arctic Circle. Board the Hurtigruten ferry, which runs from north to south and back again year round, to see the lot.</li><li><strong>Island hop, Greece</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>– there are over 6,000 Greek islands, which is a lot of hopping. Try Santorini for romance, Crete for ruins and gorges, the Ionian Islands for learning to sail, and all of them for breezy taverna lounging.</li><li><strong>Roaming the Highlands, Scotland</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>– head to the UK\'s far north for the country\'s wildest wilderness and profuse wildlife: take binoculars to look out for puffins (try the Stacks of Duncansby), golden eagles, otters in the rivers, dolphins offshore (head to Moray Firth) and red squirrels in the woods.</li><li><strong>Cycling in France</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>– the perfect place for pedalers of all abilities: pros can tackle stretches of the Tour de France (the slog up Mont Ventoux, perhaps) while more casual cyclists can ride along the Loire or Brittany\'s coast, stopping off for plenty of vin rouge en route.</li><li><strong>Meet bears and wolves, Romania</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>– the Carpathian Mountains are one of the best spots for big mammals on the continent. Trek across this little-populated region with a local guide to maximise your chances of a sighting.</li><li><strong>Hike round the Eiger, Switzerland</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>– you don\'t need to summit this mighty mountain; for the best views of all its faces, walk around it instead, stopping in Heidi-cute hamlets and wildflower meadows. The excellent and efficient Swiss transport system makes access a doddle.</li><li><strong>See Old Europe, Sicily, Italy</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>– combine an active volcano, craggy coves, sunny beaches, top nosh and a surplus of ancient ruins on this Italian island, which has a distinctly differently feel to the mainland.

Most famous are the pyramids and temples of Egypt’s Nile Valley, but equally mesmerising are the Nabataean city of Petra in Jordan, the Persian cities of Shiraz and Isfahan in Iran, and the Roman ruins of Baalbec in Lebanon and Palmyra in Syria.</p><p>Biblical landmarks are scattered across restive Israel and Palestine – countries where travel is perfectly possible and hugely rewarding, but inevitably takes on a political dimension.</p><p>Further south into Arabia, Dubai and the arid Gulf states may be best-known for oil money and ultra-luxurious hotels, but there is another side too. Oman is fast becoming the Middle East’s adventure capital, offering mountain hikes, dune bashing and Bedouin encounters in the desert.</p><p>For well-prepared travellers, turbulent Yemen harbours untouched medieval cities like Shibam and the unique wildlife of Socotra island. Between the two, and spilling into little-visited Saudi Arabia, lie the vast dunes of the Empty Quarter, explored by Wilfred Thesiger in the 1940s.</p><p>Safety is a common concern for Middle East travellers.
